# Extra Shields adds new vanilla-like shields with various tiers and different textures.

# FAQ:
### Q: Port to fabric?
A: A fabric port is not planned, I am not interested and don't have the time to maintain multiple versions. Also, I don't have any experience in fabric modding - Forge has everything I need, and I will keep supporting it.

### Q: Backport to [a version older than 1.19.2]?
A: Support for the 1.19 versions are dropped, I will now only support versions above 1.20.

### Q: Can I use the assets/code in my mod?
A: You can view and use the source code, but not the textures. If you use the code, giving credit would be cool but not mandatory.

### Q: Can I use this in my modpack?
A: You can use it in your modpacks, as long as you don't host the mod in other websites, and only use download links from Curseforge/Modrinth.
